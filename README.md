# adventureland
Repository to hold my Adventureland game data

*Note: This readme is very rough and will be updated in the future. Ask Telokis#1111 on Discord if you have questions.*

## Quickly get started

* `npm install` will install the dependencies.
* Edit the `characters.json` file to add your own information.
* Edit the `Makefile.js` file to set the value of `ADVENTURE_LAND_CODES_PATH`. The path can be found with `/codes` in the game chat. (You might need to do the command twice)

### Commands

* Use `npm run watch` to start watching the `src` directory for changes and auto-build.
* Use `npm run build` to perform a single build.
